# Topological Recursion 
This is some (very) preliminary and not optimized package to compute topological recursion invariant forms on a given spectral curve. This package runs in parallel with Combinatorica, so they both must be loaded together. 

```
Needs["Combinatorica`"]
Needs["TopologicalRecursion`"]
```

The two main functions to be used are SetSpectralCurve and TopologicalRecursionForm.
